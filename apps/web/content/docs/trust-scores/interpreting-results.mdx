# Interpreting Results

The `/api/v1/check/{owner}/{name}` endpoint returns a structured trust assessment. Here's what each field means and how to use it.

## The `safe` Boolean

This is the **primary decision field**. It combines multiple signals into a single yes/no answer:

```
safe === true  when:
  - recommendation is "safe"
  - is_outdated is false

safe === false when:
  - status is "caution", "failed", or "unscanned"
  - OR is_outdated is true (code changed since scan)
```

For most integrations, `safe` is all you need.

## Status Field

The `status` field provides more context than `safe`:

| Status | Meaning | `safe` |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `verified` | Passed all checks, code matches scan | `true` |
| `caution` | Suspicious but not clearly malicious | `false` |
| `failed` | Threats detected | `false` |
| `unscanned` | Never been scanned | `false` |

## Risk Score vs Trust Score

| Field | Range | Direction | Use Case |
|-------|-------|-----------|----------|
| `risk_score` | 0–10 | Lower is safer | Threshold-based blocking |
| `trust_score` | 0–100 | Higher is safer | UI display, sorting |

## Outdated Scans

The `is_outdated` field is critical for security:

```json
{
  "is_outdated": true,
  "scanned_commit": "abc123",
  "latest_commit": "def456"
}
```

When `is_outdated` is `true`, the code has changed since the last scan. The previous assessment no longer applies. Treat this as unverified until a new scan completes.

## About Object

The `about` field contains an AI-generated description of the skill:

```json
{
  "about": {
    "purpose": "Provides web search functionality",
    "capabilities": ["Search the web", "Return formatted results"],
    "use_cases": ["Research", "Fact-checking"],
    "permissions_required": ["network"],
    "security_notes": "Only accesses public web content"
  }
}
```

This is useful for displaying skill information to end users before they decide to install.
