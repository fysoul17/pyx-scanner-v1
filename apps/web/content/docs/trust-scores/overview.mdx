# Trust Score Overview

PYX Scanner classifies every skill into one of **three trust tiers** based on intent analysis and risk scoring.

## Three Tiers

### Verified (Risk Score 0–3)

- **Intent**: Benign
- **Meaning**: No threats detected across all 7 categories. Code does what it claims.
- **Action**: Safe to install.

### Caution (Risk Score 4–6)

- **Intent**: Risky
- **Meaning**: Suspicious patterns found but may have legitimate use. Broad permissions that could be justified by functionality.
- **Action**: Warn the user and show the summary. Let them decide.

### High Risk (Risk Score 7–10)

- **Intent**: Malicious
- **Meaning**: Clear malicious intent or high-risk patterns detected. Active threats like data exfiltration, credential theft, or destructive commands.
- **Action**: Block installation. Show findings to the user.

## Intent Classification

Before scoring, the scanner classifies the skill's intent:

| Intent | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `benign` | No harmful intent detected |
| `risky` | Broad or unusual behavior that may have legitimate explanations |
| `malicious` | Clear harmful intent |

**Cross-check rule**: If intent is `malicious` but the risk score is below 7, the score is automatically bumped to 7 to ensure consistency between intent and score.

## Confidence Score

Each scan includes a **confidence score** (0–100) indicating how certain the analysis is:

| Range | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 80–100 | High confidence — clear signals |
| 50–79 | Moderate — some ambiguity |
| 0–49 | Low — code may be obfuscated, truncated, or too complex |

Low confidence doesn't mean the skill is dangerous — it means the scanner couldn't fully analyze it. Treat low-confidence results with extra caution.
