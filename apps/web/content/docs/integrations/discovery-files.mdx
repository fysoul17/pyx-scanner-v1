# Discovery Files

PYX Scanner provides several machine-readable files for automated discovery by AI agents, LLMs, and developer tools.

## llms.txt

```
https://scanner.pyxmate.com/llms.txt
```

A concise, LLM-optimized overview of PYX Scanner — what it does, how to use the API, and the trust model. Designed for AI agents that need to understand the service quickly.

## llms-full.txt

```
https://scanner.pyxmate.com/llms-full.txt
```

Complete documentation in plain text, including full API reference, response schemas, trust model details, and recently scanned skills with live data.

## OpenAPI Spec

```
https://scanner.pyxmate.com/api/v1/openapi.json
```

OpenAPI 3.1 specification for all public API endpoints. Use this to auto-generate client libraries or integrate with API tools.

## AI Plugin Manifest

```
https://scanner.pyxmate.com/.well-known/ai-plugin.json
```

Standard AI plugin manifest for platforms that support the OpenAI plugin protocol. Points to the OpenAPI spec and describes the service for model consumption.

## Using Discovery Files

1. Fetch `/llms.txt` for a quick overview
2. Fetch `/api/v1/openapi.json` for structured API schema
3. Use the check endpoint to verify skills before installation

### For Developer Tools

If you're building a tool that integrates with PYX Scanner:

1. Fetch `/api/v1/openapi.json` to generate a typed client
2. Reference `/llms-full.txt` for complete documentation
