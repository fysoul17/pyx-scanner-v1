# Badge Integration

Show your skill's trust status with an auto-updating badge. Badges are tied to the latest scan and update automatically.

## Markdown

```markdown
[![PYX Trust Score](https://scanner.pyxmate.com/api/v1/badge/OWNER/NAME)](https://scanner.pyxmate.com/s/OWNER/NAME)
```

## HTML

```html
<a href="https://scanner.pyxmate.com/s/OWNER/NAME">
  <img
    src="https://scanner.pyxmate.com/api/v1/badge/OWNER/NAME"
    alt="PYX Trust Score"
  />
</a>
```

## Badge Styles

The badge color changes based on trust status:

| Status | Color |
|--------|-------|
| Verified | Green |
| Caution | Amber |
| High Risk | Red |
| Unscanned | Gray |

## For Platforms

If you're building a skill marketplace, you can display badges programmatically:

```jsx
function SkillBadge({ owner, name }) {
  return (
    <img
      src={`https://scanner.pyxmate.com/api/v1/badge/${owner}/${name}`}
      alt={`PYX trust score for ${owner}/${name}`}
    />
  );
}
```
