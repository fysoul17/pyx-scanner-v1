# Quick Start

Check any AI skill's trust status with a single API call. No authentication required.

## Check a Skill

```bash
curl https://scanner.pyxmate.com/api/v1/check/{owner}/{name}
```

Replace `{owner}` and `{name}` with the skill's owner and name. For example:

```bash
curl https://scanner.pyxmate.com/api/v1/check/anthropic/web-search
```

## Read the Response

The response tells you everything you need to protect your users:

```json
{
  "safe": true,
  "status": "verified",
  "recommendation": "safe",
  "risk_score": 1,
  "trust_score": 90,
  "confidence": 95,
  "is_outdated": false,
  "summary": "This skill provides web search capabilities...",
  "detail_url": "https://scanner.pyxmate.com/s/anthropic/web-search",
  "badge_url": "https://scanner.pyxmate.com/api/v1/badge/anthropic/web-search"
}
```

### Key Fields

| Field | What It Means |
|-------|---------------|
| `safe` | **Single boolean** — is this skill safe to install right now? |
| `status` | Trust tier: `verified`, `caution`, `failed`, `unscanned` |
| `risk_score` | 0–10 numeric risk (lower is safer) |
| `confidence` | 0–100 how certain the analysis is |
| `is_outdated` | Code has changed since the last scan |

## Make a Decision

```
if safe === true  → install the skill
if safe === false → check status for more context
```

That's it. See the [Agent Integration Guide](/docs/integrations/agent-guide) for the full decision flow.
