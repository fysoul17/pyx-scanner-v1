# PYX Scanner

**The Trust Layer for AI** — every AI skill scanned server-side before it reaches your users.

PYX Scanner is a security scanning API for AI skills (MCP tools, ClawHub packages, and more). It analyzes each skill for 7 threat categories and returns a structured trust assessment that your platform can use to protect users from malicious code.

## Why Integrate PYX Scanner?

AI skill ecosystems are growing fast. As platforms like OpenClaw, Claude, and others adopt MCP tools, the attack surface grows with them. PYX Scanner lets you:

- **Gate installations** — Check any skill's trust status before allowing installation
- **Show trust signals** — Display verified/caution/high-risk badges to users
- **Automate decisions** — Use the `safe` boolean for programmatic install/block logic
- **Stay current** — Scans are tied to commit hashes; if code changes, the scan is invalidated

## How It Works

1. A skill is submitted for scanning
2. PYX Scanner runs **static analysis** (20 regex rules) and **dependency scanning** (OSV.dev)
3. Results are fed into **Claude Opus** for deep security analysis across 7 threat categories
4. A structured trust assessment is produced with a risk score, intent classification, and detailed findings
5. The result is tied to the exact commit hash — tamper-proof

## Quick Example

```bash
curl https://scanner.pyxmate.com/api/v1/check/anthropic/web-search
```

```json
{
  "safe": true,
  "status": "verified",
  "risk_score": 1,
  "confidence": 95,
  "summary": "This skill provides web search capabilities..."
}
```
