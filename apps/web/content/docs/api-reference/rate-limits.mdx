# Rate Limits

All endpoints are rate-limited per IP address. No authentication is required.

## Limits by Endpoint

| Endpoint | Limit | Window |
|----------|-------|--------|
| `/api/v1/check/*` | 60 requests | per minute |
| `/api/v1/skills` | 30 requests | per minute |
| `/api/v1/badge/*` | No limit | cached |

## Response Headers

Rate limit information is returned in response headers:

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | Requests remaining in the current window |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset` | Unix timestamp when the window resets |

## Exceeding the Limit

When you exceed the rate limit, the API returns a `429` status code:

```json
{
  "error": "Rate limit exceeded"
}
```

Wait until the `X-RateLimit-Reset` timestamp before retrying.

## Tips for Agents

- Cache responses locally — skill trust status doesn't change frequently
- Use the `is_outdated` field to decide when to re-check
- Batch your checks when possible rather than checking per-request
