## Response Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `safe` | boolean | Single boolean — is this skill safe to install right now? |
| `status` | string | Trust tier: `verified`, `caution`, `failed`, `unscanned` |
| `recommendation` | string | Action hint: `safe`, `caution`, `danger`, `unknown` |
| `risk_score` | number \| null | 0–10 numeric risk score (lower is safer) |
| `trust_score` | number \| null | 0–100 trust score (higher is safer) |
| `confidence` | number \| null | 0–100 analysis confidence |
| `intent` | string \| null | `benign`, `risky`, or `malicious` |
| `is_outdated` | boolean | Code has changed since the last scan |
| `summary` | string \| null | Human-readable analysis summary |
| `about` | object \| null | AI-generated description with purpose, capabilities, and security notes |
| `category` | string \| null | Functional category of the skill |
| `detail_url` | string | Link to full scan detail page |
| `badge_url` | string | Link to SVG badge |
| `queued` | boolean | Only present on `202` responses — `true` when a scan has been auto-queued |
| `job_id` | string | Only present on `202` responses — the scan job identifier |

## Auto-Queue Behavior (202)

When you check a skill that hasn't been scanned yet, PYX Scanner will automatically queue a scan if the skill corresponds to a valid GitHub repository. The response has status `202 Accepted` and includes the same fields as a `200` response, plus `queued: true` and a `job_id`.

Poll the endpoint to check when the scan completes — the status will change from `unscanned` to a trust tier once the scan finishes.

A `404` is only returned when the GitHub repository doesn't exist or the scan queue is full.

## Error Responses

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `400` | Invalid or missing `owner`/`name` parameter |
| `404` | Skill not found and could not be auto-queued (repo doesn't exist or queue is full) |
| `429` | Rate limit exceeded (60 req/min) |
