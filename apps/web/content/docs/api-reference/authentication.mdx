# Authentication

The PYX Scanner public API is **free and requires no authentication**.

All read endpoints (`check`, `list`, `badge`) are open to everyone. No API keys, no OAuth, no headers needed.

```bash
# Just call it
curl https://scanner.pyxmate.com/api/v1/check/anthropic/web-search
```

## CORS

All API endpoints support CORS, so you can call them directly from browser-based applications.

## Rate Limits

Instead of authentication, the API uses rate limiting per IP address. See [Rate Limits](/docs/api-reference/rate-limits) for details.
